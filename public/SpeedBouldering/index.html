        <h3>How To Use:</h3>
        <p>This program was designed to be projected onto the rock wall to illuminate
          a sequence of holds and display the scores in real time to the competitors.</p>
        <p>Click Add Climber to added competitors to the event. They can be
          renamed by clicking on their names.</p>
        <p>Double click the left portion of the screen to add a hold. The number
          on the hold can be changed or dragged. Right-click the holds to delete them.</p>
        <p>To begin timing a climber, click on their current time next to their name.
          This should set them as the active climber. Click start time to begin timing
          them, and click it again to stop. If the new time is lower than their previous
          time, it will be updated to the new time. Otherwise, they will keep their old time.</p>
        <p>If a mistake is made, right-click their time and some options will appear.</p>
        <p>Click Standings to view the current standings of the competition, or to
          save the scores to a file.</p>
